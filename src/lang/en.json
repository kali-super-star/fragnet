    "customerReview1": " I have had multiple other hosting companies and none compare to them. I have had outstanding customer service with everything ive needed. They are fast to respond and help. The servers also run so smooth and i have yet to have a problem that was not an easy fix i could do myself or they have fixed for me. They are the only hosting company i will use from now on and i recommend everyone uses them! ",
    "customerReview2": " After having problems with multiple other hosters due to bad server stability and support, we changed to Fragnet. The server stability is great and also the support has a very quick response time and tries it's best at every time. ",
    "customerReview3": " Great response time and super helpful with all my questions as I have not done a Terraria server before, and coming from hosting MC servers it was a lot different. ",
    "customerReview4": " I have had Minecraft servers hosted by Fragnet on their hardware in California and the Netherlands (for the Dutch end of my players) for several years. The reliability of the hosting is EXCELLENT. I want to emphasize the support offered. They are prompt, answer even dumb questions, and keep things running flawlessly. Support is often the weak point with game server hosts, but these people could not be better!! ",
